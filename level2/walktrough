0) Random tests:
	- No argument
	- One argument
	- More than One

It seems be the same, a function asks for input stdin
and another function print the given input i can probally
search for format string exploit or gets or strcpy

1) Binary exploration:
	- Disassembling the main we can see it call to the function p
	- Disassembling the function we can see that a call to printf and a exit
		if printf has a format string vulnerability is possible to overwrite
		the address of exit with the address of system.
	- After a fast check with "%x %x %x %x" no address is leaked so lest search
		for another vulnerability, lets try to exploit gets.
